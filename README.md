Probelm statement: Predicting the employees leaving their job.
Description of the problem: 
Resigning means youâ€™re voluntarily leaving your job. When you resign, you give up all of the responsibilities associated with your job and also lose your benefits, including your salary.
I will be analyzing factors that affects employees to quit their job and creating a predictive model that can predict which employee would quit their job soon.
